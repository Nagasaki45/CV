  {2016-2021}
  {PhD in Computer Science}
  {Queen Mary University of London}
  {
    \textbf{Thesis title:} Head movement in conversation

    \textbf{Supervisors}: Prof. Patrick Healey and Dr. Julian Hough

    This PhD explores the function and form of head movement and specifically head nods in free conversation.
    It utilizes virtual reality and motion capture data analysis to explore listeners non-verbal cues in multiparty social interactions.
    Overall, this thesis questions the coherence of our intuitive notion of a head nod and the adequacy of current approaches to describe the movements involved.
    It shows how some of the common theories that describe head movement and nods fail to explain most head movement in free conversation.
    In addition, it highlights subtleties in head movement and nods that are often overlooked.

    \textbf{Activities}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Designing and running software skills workshops: Intro to Code with Python/Processing, Data Analysis with Python and Pandas, and Version Control with Git.

    \textit{Exceptional distinction (97\%)}

    \textbf{Thesis title:} \href{http://www.tomgurion.me/pdfs/Gurion - An Audio-Only Augmented Reality System for Social Interaction.pdf}{An Audio-Only Augmented Reality System for Social Interaction}

    \textbf{Supervisors:} Prof. Eitan Avitsur and Dr. Nori Jacoby.

    This thesis examines how an interactive environment might facilitate social interaction by developing and evaluating a mobile app for joint music consumption by a group of users in the same place and time.
    The app measure relative distances from a set of beacons via Bluetooth, and generates an immersive personalised musical environment that depends on the location of its participants.
    Two experiments tested the system in the context of a silent disco party, using the system's relative position signals as well as video tracking to evaluate the experience of users.
    The results showed that the system promoted openness and increased the social interaction between users.

    \textbf{Activities}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Organising the weekly seminars of the Music Technology programme.
