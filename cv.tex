\cvsection{Summary}

\begin{cvparagraph}
  I'm a Senior Software Engineer eager to make a significant impact and seeking my next challenge, ideally in a role where I can grow as a technical leader. I've consistently developed and implemented strategic solutions aligned with business objectives, from launching an AI-powered Q\&A product in weeks to improving system performance and reducing cloud costs. I thrive in environments where I can own projects from inception to completion, collaborate across teams, and delight users. I'm excited to find a role that supports work-life balance, offers opportunities to mentor others, and values expanding my technical breadth through hands-on contribution.

  \cventry
    {Senior Software Engineer}
    {Mintel}
    {London}
    {January 2024 - Present}
    {
      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {Collaborated within a 3-4 member engineering team to rapidly develop an AI-powered question-and-answer product in a six-week timeframe, achieving first-to-market status. This involved implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built on an existing Django service, utilizing OpenAI GPT-4-Turbo, Milvus for vector search, Solr for access control, and S3 for content storage. Led the data indexing pipeline to read content from S3, enrich it with metadata, chunk it, generate embeddings, and index them in Milvus.}
        \item {Led the design and development of a new backend service (using FastAPI, AsyncIO, and LangChain) to power the product, enabling rapid feature iteration and improved scalability. The design utilizes Server-Sent Events (SSE) to stream typed JSON objects to the client, including citations, images, and other data beyond the answer text. It is backed by MariaDB for conversation storage and retrieval.}
        \item {Optimized the service's performance, achieving a 6x throughput increase by replacing the LangChain Expression Language with a native AsyncIO solution and \href{https://leverstone.me/blog/performance-profiling-in-python-tools-techniques-and-an-unexpected-culprit}{addressing a performance bottleneck in the OpenTelemetry OpenAI instrumentation library}. This optimization allowed for a 7x increase in user base without additional infrastructure resources.}
        \item {Initiated and led an innovation workshop that brought together diverse perspectives from across the company. The top-voted project from the workshop progressed to the product roadmap with support from Product Development and UX teams, demonstrating my ability to bridge technical possibilities with business opportunities.}
        \item {Investigated vector databases to recommend and lead a migration from Milvus to Solr, resulting in a >50\% reduction in cloud infrastructure costs while maintaining performance benchmarks.}
        \item {Optimized the indexing pipeline, reducing processing time from three hours to under ten minutes by processing only the daily difference instead of the entire dataset. This improvement enabled a shift from weekly to daily data updates, providing users with more up-to-date market intelligence.}
        \item {Led the development and implementation of a comprehensive quality evaluation suite for AI-powered features, including answer relevancy, a \href{https://leverstone.me/blog/automating-groundedness-evaluation-in-rag-applications}{custom groundedness metric}, and traditional search relevancy metrics (Mean Average Precision and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gains). This suite incorporated LLM-as-a-Judge techniques, using OpenAI GPT-4o, to automate the evaluation process and provide data-driven insights for continuous improvement, informing prompt engineering, model updates, content retrieval adjustments (e.g., reranking), and more.}
        \item {Enhanced system observability by integrating OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, and Sentry.}
        \item {\href{https://leverstone.me/blog/mentoring-toolkit}{Mentored} two junior software engineers, focusing on their personal growth and career aspirations, while also advising on software design principles and best practices.}

        \item {Led the development of a Single Page Application (SPA) using React and TypeScript for consuming long-form content, including the design and implementation of backend APIs using Django.}
        \item {Improved code quality and team efficiency by enhancing documentation, improving testing (e.g., advocating for more idiomatic use of pytest), and refining the alerting system (Sentry).}
