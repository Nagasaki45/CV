\cvsection{Summary}

\begin{cvparagraph}
  I'm a Senior Software Engineer seeking my next challenge where I can leverage my technical and leadership skills to deliver high-impact outcomes. I've consistently developed and delivered strategic solutions aligned with business objectives, from launching an AI-powered Q\&A product in weeks to improving system performance and reducing cloud costs. I thrive in environments where I can own projects from inception to completion, collaborate across teams, and delight users. I'm excited to find a role that offers opportunities to mentor others and encourages broadening my technical skills through hands-on work.

    {London}
    {
      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {Collaborated within an agile Scrum team to rapidly develop and launch an AI-powered question-and-answer product in a six-week timeframe, achieving first-to-market status.}
        \item {Implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system on an existing Django service, using OpenAI GPT-4-Turbo, Milvus for vector search, Apache Solr for keyword search and access control, and S3 for storage.}
        \item {Led the data indexing pipeline development to read content from S3, enrich with metadata, chunk, generate embeddings, and index into Milvus.}
        \item {Led the design and development of a new backend service (using FastAPI, LangChain, and MariaDB) to enable rapid feature iteration and improved scalability. The design utilizes Server-Sent Events (SSE) to stream typed JSON objects, interleaving answer text, citations, media, and charts for informative and engaging interfaces.}
        \item {Optimized the service performance, achieving 6x throughput increase by replacing LangChain Expression Language with native AsyncIO solution and \href{https://leverstone.me/blog/performance-profiling-in-python-tools-techniques-and-an-unexpected-culprit}{resolving a bottleneck}
         in a 3rd-party open-source library, supporting a 7x user base increase without adding resources.}
        \item {Initiated and led a cross-department innovation workshop; the top-voted project was added to the roadmap and delivered, demonstrating ability to bridge technical possibilities and business needs.}
        \item {Investigated vector databases to recommend and lead a migration from Milvus to Solr, achieving >50\% reduction in cloud infrastructure costs while maintaining performance.}
        \item {Optimized the indexing pipeline, cutting processing time from three hours to under ten minutes by processing only the daily difference. This enabled a shift to daily (vs. weekly) data updates, providing users with up-to-date information.}
        \item {Led the development of an AI quality evaluation suite to measure answer relevancy, \href{https://leverstone.me/blog/automating-groundedness-evaluation-in-rag-applications}{groundedness}, and traditional information retrieval metrics; incorporating LLM-as-a-Judge (OpenAI GPT-4o) for automation; providing data-driven insights for continuous improvement like prompt engineering, model updates, and retrieval adjustments.}
        \item {Enhanced system observability by integrating OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, and Sentry.}
        \item {\href{https://leverstone.me/blog/mentoring-toolkit}{Mentored} two junior software engineers, focusing on personal growth and career aspirations, while also advising on software design principles and best practices.}
