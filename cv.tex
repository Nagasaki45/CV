    \textbf{Thesis title:} Exploring real-time models of head nods in free conversation using virtual reality

    \textbf{Supervisors}: Prof. Patrick Healey and Dr. Julian Hough

    This PhD research explores models of head movement, and head nods in particular, in free conversation.
    It uses virtual reality technologies to explore listeners non-verbal cues in multiparty social interactions.
    Findings from this research can inform new telecommunication technologies about socially relevant non-verbal cues and suggest guidelines for the implementation of embodied conversational agents.

    \textbf{Activities}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Designing and running software skills workshops: Intro to Code with Python/Processing, Data Analysis with Python and Pandas, and Version Control with Git.
      \item
        Teaching assistance for ``Interactive Digital Multimedia Techniques'', ``Parallel Computing'', and ``Arts Application Programming'' modules.

    \textbf{Thesis title:} \href{http://www.tomgurion.me/pdfs/Gurion - An Audio-Only Augmented Reality System for Social Interaction.pdf}{An Audio-Only Augmented Reality System for Social Interaction}

    \textbf{Supervisors:} Prof. Eitan Avitsur and Dr. Nori Jacoby.

    This thesis examines how an interactive environment might facilitate social interaction by developing and evaluating a mobile app for joint music consumption by a group of users in the same place and time.
    The app measure relative distances from a set of beacons via Bluetooth, and generates an immersive personalised musical environment that depends on the location of its participants.
    Two experiments tested the system in the context of a silent disco party, using the system's relative position signals as well as video tracking to evaluate the experience of users.
    The results showed that the system promoted openness and increased the social interaction between users.

    \textbf{Activities}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Organising the weekly seminars of the Music Technology programme.
